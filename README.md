# webler-flutter-demo
This is a demo of Webler app with Flutter. This project helps us to develop the Webler app for iOS devices and Android devices. There will also be Desktop versions of this app for Windows, MacOS and Linux, even though the primary focus of this project is to develop apps for the mobile platforms of iOS and Android.
